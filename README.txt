What it is:
Primarily a demo of a basic ASP.NET MVC 2 project. 
Secondarily, it is a database of the Chinese Zodiac animals with an ugly brown background.

Status:
Main goals complete, but didn't attempt all of my targets on the 'about' page.

Details:
I wanted to get an understanding of ASP.NET MVC projects. But I'm on holiday and don't have a Windows machine with me. And unfortunately 99% of tutorials on the subject are of the "Fire up Visual Studio!" variety. After a couple of days of research I've built a simple project in MonoDevelop that showcases the fundamental stuff and (hopefully) good coding style. 

Ideally, this can help someone else on Linux or Mac to get started with ASP.NET MVC too. I'd recommend looking up tutorials by Stephen Walther and Steve Fenton, as well as the official Microsoft documentation at asp.net/mvc. Also, look up the difference between HTTP GET and POST requests. 

This project demonstrates: 
* Good project structure.
* Querying and editing an SQLite database.
* Using parameterization to prevent SQL injection attacks.
* Creating strongly-typed Views (the non-GUI way).
* Using Controllers to get data from the Model to the Views.
* Using HTML forms to get data from a View to the Model.
* Validating those forms.
* The Post-Redirect-Get (PRG) pattern.
* Use of the Site.master file and ContentControls to minimize HTML repetition.
* Bad taste in background colors.

Development Platform:
Mono 2.10.8
Sqlite 3.7.5
MonoDevelop 2.8.5
Firefox 9.0.1
